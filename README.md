# Installation
```
npm install
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
optionally you can modify the pkg.sh file for your operating system and run it to produce an executable file.

# Usage

default is to clone all cycles and their folders from the version 'Testbasis GST' to a given version (parameter 1, non-optional).
additionally you can choose to delete all cycles of specific version if you provide a second parameter called 'delete'. Be very careful with this option.

```
./index <Version> <delete>(optional)
```

if there was no executable file created:
```
node index.js <Version> <delete>(optional)
```
